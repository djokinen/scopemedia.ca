		<h1>A focus on partnership.</h1>
		<p>Hello, we're Scope Media. We help businesses communicate.</p>
		<p>Our language is graphic design. We specialize in translating words and numbers into ideas and conversations. We strive to always speak clearly, concisely and with purpose.</p>
		<p>We understand business and never lose sight of the objectives unique to each project. We strive for the balance of Form <em>and</em> Function—to create work that looks great and articulates strategically.</p>
		<p>We prefer to call our clients, “partners” (or by their first names). By getting to know them and their businesses, we are able to best identify and deliver strategic solutions that meet their unique communication needs.</p>
		<p>We offer competitive pricing packages aimed at nurturing ongoing business relationships. The reason for this is simple—focus. Our experience has proven that with increased familiarity, comes a greater chance for mutual business success.          Please contact us for a clear perspective on your next visual communications project.          </p>
